Information
=======

This application will look in the "BRIO ABOVE" sheet and it will find lines with the same scp host; then it will eliminate duplicates while keeping the middleware names. This data will then be exported to the "Hosts" sheet while then scanning the middlewares in each host to remove duplicates from there.
This was a project requested from me at work. It went into "production" and to date continues to be used for audit data request fulfilllment. During an audit, server inventories had to be reviewed as part of a data request. The data had to be purged before handing over to the audit team and so my assistance was requested. This application was created using VBA for excel.

IMPORTANT:

No intelectual property nor exclusivity agreements were signed. This program is considered a personal project of my belonging focused on career development.
